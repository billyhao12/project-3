# The Nomad

Deployed application: https://the-nomad.herokuapp.com/

## Description

The Nomad is a community driven publication application with forum discussion. It utilizes GPS location to emphasize the area of relevance to an article's publication, with a radius in which other users can interact with an article's forum discussion. A user can post an article and set the radius of relevance. Only users that fall within the radius of relevance are able to comment on a given forum, as the emphasis of this application is community interaction. Users are able to rate articles. The higher the rating, the higher up the page that the article will be posted in the reader's feed.

There is an increasing distrust in mainstream media, with consumers of media becoming "media fatigued" with needing to suss out what is truth, what is opinion, and what is spin. The goal of this application is to create a community of publishers that can report, first hand, what they are encountering in their community. The caveat to a user posting and selecting the radius of relevance is with a greater user base interacting with an article, the greater the scrutiny the article will be under. It is in the publisher's best interest to verify facts, keep spin to a minimum and appeal to the group that they believe to be relevant to their articles.
